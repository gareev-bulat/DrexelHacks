## Inspiration
Our project started not in a boardroom but over coffee, snacks, and lots of frustration. It was impossible to keep pace with the financial news: one day the headlines shout crash, the next shout rally.

One of our colleagues joked, "I wish something would just read all this and tell me what to do!"
We giggled — and then caught on: why not?

That flame fueled the blaze.
We wanted to build an AI that reads the latest news, gets the sentiment, and gives instant, unambiguous advice: buy, sell, or hold. No small talk. No second-guessing. Just do it.

A missed opportunity, some frustration, and lots of curiosity became something we're excited to bring to the world.

## What's next for HeadlineTrader
Looking ahead, we see several avenues to evolve HeadlineTrader into a robust platform. We plan to roll out a paper-trading mode so users can refine strategies without risking capital, and create a marketplace where third-party quants can offer custom signal models that users subscribe to. On the product side, we aim to launch native iOS and Android apps for on-the-go monitoring and push notifications when market-moving headlines break. Finally, we’ll integrate back-testing tools and performance attribution reports, empowering users to analyze which news sources and AI models drive the most alpha in their portfolios.
